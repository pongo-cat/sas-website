                <p>Alex Iannuzzi grew up in Franklinton, North Carolina, near the Raleigh-Durham area.
                    They have been making art for many years, but began to take it seriously as a career while attending the University of Alabama.
                    Currently, they are located in Tuscaloosa, Alabama and are working on their BS in Computer Science and Mathematics and a minor in Studio Art.
                    They have always loved animals, especially horses, and have been an avid equestrian all their life, so they especially love making art of equines.
                    During their free time, they enjoy riding horses, playing video games, and walking in nature, where they find much of their artistic inspiration.
