                <h2>Pet and Family Portraiture</h2>
                <p>I would be honored to immortalize your pet and/or human loved ones in a handmade portrait that will last a lifetime. 
                    I can do human portraiture, but specialize in animals. I offer both oil-on-canvas and charcoal on paper artworks.
                    To begin, I will need a high-quality photograph of the subject(s) you would like me to paint and a deposit of 50% of the total cost.
                    Once commissioned, a painting will take approximately 3-4 weeks to complete, after which I will very carfully pack it and ship it to you.
                    I will work with you to ensure that the painting is exactly what you want, and I will also send you a final photo of the painting before shipping it to you to ensure that you are satisfied with the final product.
                    My contact information can be <a href = "contact.php">found here</a>.</p>
